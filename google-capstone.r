The director\nof marketing believes the company‚Äôs future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,\nyour team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.\n\n****Characters and teams****\n\n‚óè Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can‚Äôt use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to\ncommute to work each day.\n\n‚óè Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.\n\n‚óè Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic‚Äôs mission and business goals ‚Äî as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.\n\n\n‚óè Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the\n\n\nGuiding questions\n\n‚óè What is the problem you are trying to solve?\n  \n  The company's future success has been said to be dependent on maximizing the anual membership holder and hence the problem here is our to get casual riders to become annual members.\n\n‚óè How can your insights drive business decisions?\n\nFrom the insights gotten, a new marketing strategy would be designed to convert casual riders to annual riders.\n\n***Key tasks***\n1. Identify the business task\n2. Consider key stakeholders\n\n***Deliverable***\nA clear statement of the business task\n\nTo better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics.\n\n***Guiding Questions.***\n1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?\n2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?\n3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"part3\"></p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Arials; font-size: 16px; font-style: bold; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 3px; color: #FF8C00\">PREPARE</p>\n<hr style=\"height: 0.5px; border: 0; background-color: #808080\">\n\n\nCyclistic‚Äôs historical trip data to analyze and identify trends and the datasets.

Does your data ROCCC?\n\nThere are no issues with bias and credibility as measures such as( removal of  trips that are taken by staff as they service and inspect the system; and any trips that were below 60 seconds in length (potentially false starts or users trying to re-dock a bike to ensure it was secure).) and yes the dataset is \n* reliable\n* original \n* comprehensive\n* current. \n* cited.\n\n‚óè How are you addressing licensing, privacy, security, and accessibility?\n\n The company has their own licence over the dataset and there are no personal or very sensitive information about the riders in the dataset also accessing the dataset is quite easy. To review the company's licence [Click here](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)\n \n‚óè How did you verify the data‚Äôs integrity?\n\nThere are consistent namings for each columns and the data formats are correct for each column. Also null values are removed.\n\n‚óè How does it help you answer your question?\n\nNoticable trends about the casual and annual riders can help understand the behaviour\n\n‚óè Are there any problems with the data?\n\n***Key tasks***\n1.

This probably indicates that the distance travelled by casual riders is much longer or they travelled at shorter speed (The use of docked by by only casual riders which is assumed to travel at the smallest speed amongs the three types of bikes could also be a cause).\n\n‚óè What trends or relationships did you find in the data?\n\n1. One of the trends in the data was that member subscribers didnt use the docked bike and a few of casual users uses it.\n\n2. Also membership subscribers had most of there trips in the weekdays like(wednessday,tuesday,thursday,monday) and had less trips during the weekends.\n\n3. Casual users had most of there trips during the weekends unlike the membership subscribers.\n\n4. From the analysis the top 10 route for casual users and membership Subscribers was gotten\n\n\n‚óè How will these insights help answer your business questions?\n\nUnderstanding the casual users behaviour helps to take descicion that would encourage them to do member subscription\n\nKey tasks\n1.

Yes from the insight gotten, it turns out that casual users tend to ride more on weekends (saturdays and sundays) and other weekdays and the members subscribers\n tends to ride more on weekdays(wednessday,tuesday,thursday,friday and monday) \n \n 2. Also the difference in the top 10 travel route for both casual users and membership subscribers was obvious.\n \n‚óè What story does your data tell?\n\n**Interesting stories indeed!!!**\n\n1. According to [A chicago bike blog](https://www.chicagobikeblog.com/blog/2018/9/21/the-best-time-to-ride-your-bike-is-now), Autumn is the best weather for cycling in chicago  this explains the reason while the highest number of trips by electric bike was recorded in September, October and November.\n\n2. Also it was clearly seen on the line graph that there was a rapid increase in the no of trip from 15 - 20 hours and its peak at about 17 hours. this numbers makes sense as  16 - 18 hours i.e 4pm - 6pm has been regarded by [Tripsavvy](https://www.tripsavvy.com/driving-in-chicago-what-you-need-to-know-4175905) as a rush hour hence there heavy traffic in that hour and this is a strong correlation with the increase in the use of bikes by that hour(15 - 18 hours).\n\n\n\n‚óè How do your findings relate to your original question?\n\n*The finding tells that how members riding habits are different from casual riders. And how marketing team can make strategy to influence them through digital media.\n‚óè Who is your audience? What is the best way to communicate with them?\n‚óè Can data visualization help you share your findings?\n‚óè Is your presentation accessible to your audience?\nKey tasks\n1. Determine the best way to share your findings.\n2. Create effective data visualizations.\n3. Present your findings.\n4.

The top 10 route with the highest number of ride should be targeted, also  the later part of summer (July , August) and Autumn fall (September, October) which seem to have the highest trip should include nice membership subscription package and probably be a target  for the digital media campaign.\n \n\n\n2. More attractive membership offers should be made available for rush hour ride(4pm - 6pm  or 16hours - 18hours) as both casual and member rider has there peak number of trip by that hour.\n\n\n\n3. Exciting weekend offer should be made available for the membership subscription plan as most casual riders ride on weekends.\n\n\n\n4. Futher data could also be collected to ascertain reasons why they might not prefer annual member subcription.\n\n\n5. It was observed that member riders didnt use docked bike at all, the data collected did not specifically state that docked bike is not in the member riders subscription if so, it should be included in the plan to encourage casual riders who would want to ride docked bike.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<p style=\"font-family: Arials; line-height: 1.5; font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 2px; text-align: center; color: #008000\">Thank you for reading this work!\nAny feedback on this work would be very grateful.\nIf you liked this notebook, put your votes.</p>\n    <p style=\"text-align: center\">üòäüòäüòä</p>","metadata":{}}]}
